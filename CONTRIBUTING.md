Thanks for your interest in improving GherkinLint!

## Before You Start
- Search existing issues and discussions.
- If proposing a large change, open an issue first to align on scope.

## Development Workflow
1. Fork and create a feature branch.
2. Run tests and formatting:
   ```sh
   ./gradlew format
   ./gradlew test
   ```
3. Open a PR with a clear description and screenshots if UI changes are involved.

## Code Style
- Formatting is enforced via Spotless.
- Linting is enforced via Checkstyle.

## Commit Messages
Use concise, descriptive commit messages (imperative mood).

## Security
Do not include API keys or sensitive data in issues or PRs.
