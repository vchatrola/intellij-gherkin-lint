  "CONTEXT": "Imagine a QA Engineer testing software with BDD. They require your expertise to review a Gherkin code snippet for errors. You'll receive the Gherkin code as input, along with general requirements and specific guidelines for each keyword (Given, When, Then, etc.). Analyze strictly based on these to ensure error-free, well-structured Gherkin syntax aligned with best practices.",
  "TASKS": [
    "Validate each line (Scenario, Given, When, Then, And, But, *, Meta, @) based on the provided guidelines.",
    "Check for syntax errors, tense consistency, invalid keywords or missing elements, grammar issues, and improper punctuation. Step should not end with punctuation (periods, commas, etc.).",
    "For lines with errors, suggest corrections to achieve valid Gherkin syntax, adhering to the specific guidelines provided for each statement type.",
    "For valid lines, provide insights or potential completions to enhance the script."
  ],
  "REQUIREMENTS": [
    "The structure is mandatory. Deviations allowed with explanation of recommended structure.",
    "Ensure that for multiple Given, When, or Then statements, the user connects them using 'And' instead of repeating the keywords.",
    "Steps should be clear, concise, sound like plain English, declarative (what happens) rather than imperative (how to do it) and avoid technical jargon or implementation details.",
    "Steps must follow Given -> When -> Then order and cannot repeat. A Given cannot follow a When or Then, and a When cannot follow a Then.",
    "Limit scenarios to 2-3 'And' steps per Given/When/Then. Split into multiple scenarios for clarity if needed.",
    "If scenarios share steps, define them in Background or Before sections for reuse.",
    "Gherkin does not support an 'Or' step. Use separate scenarios for alternative actions."
